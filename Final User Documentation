When trying to run the Java functionality (Main.java, UserManagement.java, InventoryManagement.java), you will need to create 3 text files:
a file for users, a file for inventory, and a file for reports. Use the provided User file to get started (Userfile.txt) since these users
have encrypted passwords alread. When running Main.java and it asks for an employee ID enter "12345" and password "Monroe", after the first
login, you can create your own username and password. You will also need to update the paths for the text files in the code from the paths 
that were on my personal computer to the paths on your computer in order to get the project to run.
